# Demeter
Rust made POC for generating ASTs (using treesitter) for C code (can be easily modified for other languages).

### Description:
- Why you may ask? well simple, if you'd like to do automated static code analysis and write your framework in rust, here you go! Go generate that AST and get started!

---

- I added a code cleanup and recursive directory searcher for files as utilities.
